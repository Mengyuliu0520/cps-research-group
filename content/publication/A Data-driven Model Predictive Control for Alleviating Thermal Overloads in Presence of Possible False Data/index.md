abstract: Effective mitigation of thermal overloads is crucial in preventing
  power grid outages. With large-scale adoption of phasor measurement units, new
  and more effective mitigation opportunities have emerged. However, the
  possibility of false data attacks on the measured data, or the relay status
  information, threatens the promise of utilizing measurements for timely
  mitigation of thermal overloads. False data can lead to wrong estimation of
  the system states and the power flow model, which may eventually lead to wrong
  mitigations. To address these newly introduced challenges, in this article, a
  data-driven model-predictive control method is introduced for mitigation of
  the thermal overloads, which is resilient to false data injection attacks.
  This is achieved by constructing a data-driven power flow model from the
  trustworthy system measurements, which is independent from system topology and
  model parameters. Hence, the power flow model becomes immune to wrong system
  model information. To eliminate the adverse impacts of false data on the
  measurements, the actual system states are recovered from the historical
  trustworthy data if an attack is detected. Case studies demonstrate that the
  developed model predictive control methodology effectively identifies the
  optimal mitigations in a finite prediction horizon.
