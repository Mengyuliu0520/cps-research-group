abstract: Automobiles continue to become more autonomous and connected as
  increasingly integrating with information technology. Meanwhile, this advance
  also comes with a higher risk of various security violations on vehicles. In
  this paper, we study how to detect attacks on autonomous vehicles, and
  specially focus on physical invariant-based attack detection. A physical
  invariant (PI) is defined as a property that a physical system always holds,
  i.e., the evolution of system states (usually measured by sensors) follows
  immutable physical laws. We first discuss existing research efforts of
  PI-based attack detection and classify them according to the knowledge of
  physical invariants and sensor redundancy. Then, we point out several critical
  challenges on attack detection research efforts including data sets, benchmark
  and testbeds, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight open problems that
  offer promising research opportunities.
