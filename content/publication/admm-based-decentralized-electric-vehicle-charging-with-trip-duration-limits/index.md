abstract: "With the large-scale deployment of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the
  unbalanced distribution of charging needs and random charging behaviors cause
  charging stations (CSs) congestion. This degrades EV drivers' quality of
  experience by extending charging waiting time and increasing charging fee.
  Thus, EV owners are facing a critical issue on how to decrease the cost of
  charging, which consists of two parts: charging duration and charging fee. A
  great deal of existing work is confined to finding CSs to optimize the two
  parts individually. However, it still remains unexplored how to jointly
  minimize charging duration and charging fee under an overall time limit (i.e.,
  deadline) of a scheduled trip. The problem is the focus of this paper. First,
  we formulate this problem as a 0-1 Integer Linear Programming problem and show
  its NP-Hardness. Then, we propose an efficient distributed algorithm based on
  the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The algorithm
  decomposes the original problem into sub-problems that can be solved locally
  and in parallel between charging stations and the global coordinator. Finally,
  we carry out extensive simulations based on real-life transport network data,
  and the results show that the proposed approach brings significant cost
  savings over existing ones."
