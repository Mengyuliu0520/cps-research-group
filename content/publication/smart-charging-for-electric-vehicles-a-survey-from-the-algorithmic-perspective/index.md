abstract: Smart interactions among the smart grid, aggregators, and EVs can
  bring various benefits to all parties involved, e.g., improved reliability and
  safety for the smart grid increased profits for the aggregators, as well as
  enhanced self-benefit for EV customers. This survey focuses on viewing these
  smart interactions from an algorithmic perspective. In particular, important
  dominating factors for coordinated charging from three different perspectives
  are studied, in terms of smart grid oriented, aggregator oriented, and
  customer-oriented smart charging. Firstly, for smart grid-oriented EV
  charging, we summarize various formulations proposed for load flattening,
  frequency regulation, and voltage regulation, then explore the nature and
  substantial similarity among them. Secondly, for aggregator-oriented EV
  charging, we categorize the algorithmic approaches proposed by research works
  sharing this perspective as direct and indirect coordinated control, and
  investigate these approaches in detail. Thirdly, for customer-oriented EV
  charging, based on a commonly shared objective of reducing charging cost, we
  generalize different formulations proposed by studied research works.
  Moreover, various uncertainty issues, e.g., EV fleet uncertainty, electricity
  price uncertainty, regulation demand uncertainty, etc., have been discussed
  according to the three perspectives classified. At last, we discuss
  challenging issues that are commonly confronted during modeling the smart
  interactions, and outline some future research topics in this exciting area.
