abstract: Cloud-based video streaming systems such as YouTube and Netflix are
  usually supported by content delivery networks and data centers that can
  consume many megawatts of power. Most existing work independently studies the
  issues of improving quality of experience (QoE) for viewers and reducing the
  cost and emissions associated with the enormous energy usage of data centers.
  By contrast, this paper addresses them both, and jointly optimizes the QoE,
  the energy cost, and emissions by intelligently allocating data center
  bandwidth among different client groups. Specially, we propose a distributed
  algorithm to achieve the optimal bandwidth allocation, given the prediction of
  future workload. The algorithm novelly decomposes the optimization process
  into separate ones, which are solved iteratively across data centers and
  clients. Further, the algorithm has a robust performance guarantee in terms of
  the variance of the prediction error. We demonstrate its convergence and
  robustness by both proofs using theoretical analysis and validation based on
  trace-driven simulations. The results further show that the proposed algorithm
  converges very fast and achieves a much better QoE-cost balance than existing
  approaches.
