abstract: The increasing autonomy and connectivity have been transitioning
  automobiles to complex and open architectures that are vulnerable to malicious
  attacks beyond conventional cyber attacks. Attackers may non-invasively
  compromise sensors and spoof the controller to perform unsafe actions. This
  concern emphasizes the need to validate sensor data before acting on them.
  Unlike existing works, this paper exploits inherent redundancy among
  heterogeneous sensors for detecting anomalous sensor measurements. The
  redundancy is that multiple sensors simultaneously respond to the same
  physical phenomenon in a related fashion. Embedding the redundancy into a deep
  autoencoder, we propose an anomaly detector that learns a consistent pattern
  from vehicle sensor data in normal states and utilizes it as the nominal
  behavior for the detection. The proposed method is independent of the scarcity
  of anomalous data for training and the intensive calculation of pairwise
  correlation among senors as in existing works. Using a real-world data set
  collected from tens of vehicle sensors, we demonstrate the feasibility and
  efficacy of the proposed method.
