  Electric vehicles are gaining more and more popularity due to low oil
  dependency and low emission. Their deep penetration will significantly benefit
  the environment, but meanwhile will cause two crucial consequences. First,
  electric vehicles introduce heavy load impact into the power grid by shifting
  energy demand from gasoline to electricity. The surging load will compromise
  the grid’s reliability and jeopardize its power supply quality. Second,
  charging stations become indispensable infrastructure to support large
  deployment of electric vehicles. The availability in public destinations comes
  with electric vehicles competing for both power supply and service points of
  charging stations. The competition degrades quality of service and thus can
  compromise the original intent of advocating electric vehicles. There are many
  research efforts addressing either of the two consequences above. Different
  with them, we consider both and jointly study quality of service for electric
  vehicle users and reliability of the power grid. We review recent developments
  on this topic in this article. In Chapter 1, we introduce the ecosystem of
  electric vehicles and discuss motivations for managing charging load. This
  chapter further presents a systematic solution framework for smart electric
  vehicle charging. The following chapters then study each block of the
  framework. Specially, in Chapter 2, we investigate charging rate control,
  which handles how to allocate power supply to electric vehicles within a
  charging station. In Chapter 3, we address electric vehicle demand response,
  which is how to make electric vehicles follow the power supply of charging
  stations and the power grid. In Chapter 4, we study electric vehicle
  scheduling, which copes with how to schedule electric vehicles to multiple
  charging points within a charging station. In Chapter 5, we discuss charging
  demand balancing, which deals with how to balance electric vehicles among
  multiple charging stations. In these chapters, we first present deployable
  algorithms and mechanisms that are designed for each framework blocks. Then,
  we evaluate the proposed approaches by two complementary ways. One way is
  leveraging theoretical analysis to demonstrate their performance guarantees,
  while the other is using extensive simulations based on realistic data traces
  and simulation tools. We also review studies that align with the corresponding
  framework blocks and consider additional dimensions and/or different
  optimization goals. Finally, in Chapter 6, we conclude the article with
  summaries of main ideas discussed in the previous chapters.
