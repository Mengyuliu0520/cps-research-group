abstract: While much work has addressed energy minimizing problem of real-time
  sequential tasks, little has been done for the parallel real-time task case.
  In this paper, based on level-packing, we study energy minimization problem
  for parallel task systems with discrete operation modes and under timing
  constraints. For tasks with fixed (variable) parallel degrees, we first
  formulate the problem as a 0-1 Integer Linear Program (0-1 ILP), and then
  propose a polynomial-time complexity two-step (three-step) heuristic to
  determine task schedule and frequency assignment (and the task parallel
  degree). Our simulation result shows that the heuristics consume nearly the
  same energy as do 0-1 ILPs.
