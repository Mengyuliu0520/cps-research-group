abstract: Real-time advertising allows advertisers to bid for each impression

  for a visiting user. To optimize specific goals such as maximizing

  revenue and return on investment (ROI) led by ad placements, advertisers not only need to estimate the relevance between the ads and

  userâ€™s interests, but most importantly require a strategic response

  with respect to other advertisers bidding in the market. In this paper,

  we formulate bidding optimization with multi-agent reinforcement

  learning. To deal with a large number of advertisers, we propose a

  clustering method and assign each cluster with a strategic bidding

  agent. A practical Distributed Coordinated Multi-Agent Bidding

  (DCMAB) has been proposed and implemented to balance the tradeoff between the competition and cooperation among advertisers.

  The empirical study on our industry-scaled real-world data has

  demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods. Our results show

  cluster-based bidding would largely outperform single-agent and

  bandit approaches, and the coordinated bidding achieves better

  overall objectives than purely self-interested bidding agents.
