abstract: In the real world, it is quite meaningful to forecast the day-ahead
  electricity load for an area, which is beneficial to the reduction of
  electricity waste and rational arrangement of electric generator units. The
  deployment of various sensors strongly pushes this forecasting research into a
  “big data” era for a huge amount of information has been accumulated.
  Meanwhile, the prosperous development of deep learning (DL) theory provides
  powerful tools to handle massive data and often outperforms conventional
  machine learning methods in many traditional fields. Inspired by these, we
  propose a deep learning-based model which firstly refines features by stacked
  denoising auto-encoders (SDAs) from history electricity load data and related
  temperature parameters, subsequently trains a support vector regression (SVR)
  model to forecast the day-ahead total electricity load. The most significant
  contribution of this heterogeneous deep model is that the abstract features
  extracted by SADs from original electricity load data are proven to describe
  and forecast the load tendency more accurately with lower errors. We evaluate
  this proposed model by comparing it with plain SVR and artificial neural
  networks (ANNs) models, and the experimental results validate its performance
  improvements.
