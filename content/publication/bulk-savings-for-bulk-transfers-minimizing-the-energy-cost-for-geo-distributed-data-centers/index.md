abstract: With the fast proliferation of cloud computing, major cloud service
  providers, e.g., Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc., have been deploying more and
  more geographically distributed data centers to provide customers with better
  reliability and quality of services. A basic demand in such a geo-distributed
  data center system is to transfer bulk volumes of data from one data center to
  another. Geographic distribution and large delay-tolerance of such
  inter-data-center bulk data transfers provide cloud service providers
  opportunities to optimize the operating cost. Most existing studies on
  inter-data-center bulk data transfers focus on minimizing the network
  bandwidth cost. However, the energy cost of the bulk data transfers, which
  also accounts for a large proportion of operating costs in the data centers,
  still remains unexplored. This is an important problem, especially in the
  multi-electricity market environment, where the electricity price exhibits
  both spatial and temporal diversities. In this paper, we systematically study
  the problem of how to route and schedule inter-data-center bulk data transfers
  to minimize the energy cost for geo-distributed data centers. We model this
  problem as a min-cost multi-commodity flow problem and develop an efficient
  two-stage optimization method to solve it. Extensive evaluations with
  real-life inter-data-center networks and electricity prices show that our
  method brings significant energy-cost savings over existing bulk data transfer
  methods.
