abstract: Demand response is considered a valuable functionality of the power
  grid and its potential impacts continue expanding with grid modernization.
  Colocation data centers (simply called colocation) are recognized as a notably
  promising resource for demand response due to their high power demand and
  remarkable potential in demand management. A major challenge of colocation
  demand response is the split incentive, that is, colocation operators, desire
  demand response for financial compensation while tenants may not embrace
  demand response due to lack of incentives. Another key challenge is caused by
  renewable energy co-located with data centers. Demand response mechanisms
  overlooking the uncertainty of renewable would cause many inefficiencies in
  terms of energy-saving and economic aspects. Existing work considers the two
  challenges separately in the context of data centers. By contrast, this work
  jointly addresses them and especially studies mechanism design for colocation
  data centers in presence of co-located renewable. We propose a hierarchical
  demand response scheme, which is based on a new two-level market mechanism
  that results in a win-win situation for both parties, i.e., tenants who choose
  to reduce power demand obtain financial rewards from the operator, while the
  operator receives financial compensation from the electric power company due
  to its tenants' demand reduction. At each demand response period, the
  colocation operator solicits bids (amount of energy reduction) from tenants,
  and tenants who choose to participate responds to the operator with their
  bids. The proposed mechanism provably converges to a unique equilibrium
  solution, and at the equilibrium, neither the operator nor tenants can improve
  their individual economic performance by changing their own strategies.
  Further, we present a stochastic optimization-based algorithm, which uses
  predictions of the co-located renewable to determine the colocation operator's
  best strategy. At the equilibrium, the algorithm has a provable economic
  performance guarantee in terms of the prediction error. We finally evaluate
  the designed mechanism via detailed simulations and the results show the
  efficacy and validate the theoretical analysis for the mechanism.
