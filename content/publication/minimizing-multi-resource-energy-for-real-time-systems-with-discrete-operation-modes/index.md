abstract: Energy conservation is an important issue in the design of embedded
  systems. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) and Dynamic Power Management (DPM) are
  two widely used techniques for saving energy in such systems. In this paper,
  we address the problem of minimizing multi-resource energy consumption
  concerning both CPU and devices. A system is assumed to contain a fixed number
  of real-time tasks scheduled to run on a DVS-enabled processor, and a fixed
  number of off-chip devices used by the tasks during their executions. We will
  study the non-trivial time and energy overhead of device state transitions
  between active and sleep states. Our goal is to find optimal schedules
  providing not only the execution order and CPU frequencies of tasks, but also
  the time points for device state transitions. We adopt the frame-based
  real-time task model, and develop optimization algorithms based on 0-1 Integer
  Non-Linear Programming (0-1 INLP) for different system configurations.
  Simulation results indicate that our approach can significantly outperform
  existing techniques in terms of energy savings.
