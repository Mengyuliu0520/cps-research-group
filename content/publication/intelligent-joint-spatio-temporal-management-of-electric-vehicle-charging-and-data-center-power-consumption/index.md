abstract: A data center is designed to have the capacity matching spike workload
  from a geographical region. This design concept comes with a significant waste
  of expense on power peak charged by the electrical grid, since workload
  fluctuations cause large variations in data center power demand. On the other
  hand, electric vehicles (EVs) have been emerging as major electricity
  consumers due to their large power demand for battery charging. In this paper,
  we propose a ValleyFill method that explores EVs to fill power valleys of
  geographically distributed data centers without increasing their power peaks.
  Leveraging geographical diversities of workload processing and temporal
  flexibilities of EV charging, this method determines routing scheme for
  workload and charging schedule for EVs to improve cost efficiency on the peak
  charge. We evaluate the proposed method with real-world workload traces and EV
  arrival patterns. The result shows that our method significantly improves the
  cost efficiency and saves up to 6% on total electricity bills. We observe that
  a data center with larger gap between its power peak and valley leads to less
  charging time for EVs and less workload migration.
