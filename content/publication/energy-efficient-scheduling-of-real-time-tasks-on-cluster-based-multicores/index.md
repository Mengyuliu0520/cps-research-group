abstract: While much work has addressed the energy-efficient scheduling problem
  for uniprocessor or multiprocessor systems, little has been done for multicore
  systems. We study the multicore architecture with a fixed number of cores
  partitioned into clusters (or islands), on each of which all cores operate at
  a common frequency. We develop algorithms to determine a schedule for
  real-time tasks to minimize the energy consumption under the timing and
  operating frequency constraints. As technical contributions, we first show
  that the optimal frequencies resulting in the minimum energy consumption for
  each island is not dependent on the workload mapped but the number of cores
  and leakage power on the island, when not considering the timing constraint.
  Then for systems with timing constraints, we present a polynomial algorithm
  which derives the minimum energy consumption for a given task partition.
  Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine the number of active
  islands, task partition and frequency assignment. Our simulation result shows
  that our approach significantly outperforms the related approaches in terms of
  energy saving.
