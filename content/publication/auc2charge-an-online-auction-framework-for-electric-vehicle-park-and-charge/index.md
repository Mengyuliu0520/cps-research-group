abstract: The increasing market share of electric vehicles (EVs) makes
  large-scale charging stations indispensable infrastructure for integrating EVs
  into the future smart grid. Thus their operation modes have drawn great
  attention from researchers. One promising mode called park-and-charge was
  recently proposed. It allows people to park their EVs at a parking lot, where
  EVs can get charged during the parking time. This mode has been experimented
  and demonstrated in small scale. However, the missing of an efficient market
  mechanism is an important gap preventing its large-scale deployment. Existing
  pricing policies, e.g., pay-by-use and flat-rate pricing, would jeopardize the
  efficiency of electricity allocation and the corresponding social welfare in
  the park-and-charge mode, and thus are inapplicable. To find an efficient
  mechanism, this paper explores the feasibility and benefits of utilizing
  auction mechanism in the EV park-and-charge mode. The auction allows EV users
  to submit and update bids on their charging demand to the charging station,
  which makes corresponding electricity allocation and pricing decisions. To
  this end, we propose Auc2Charge, an online auction framework. Auc2Charge is
  truthful and individual rational. Running in polynomial time, it provides an
  efficient electricity allocation for EV users with a close-form approximation
  ratio on system social welfare. Through both theoretical analysis and
  numerical simulation, we demonstrate the efficacy of Auc2Charge in terms of
  social welfare and user satisfaction.
