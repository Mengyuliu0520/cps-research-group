abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely deployed and it is
  crucial to properly control the energy consumption of the sensor nodes to
  achieve the maximum WSNs' operation time (i.e., lifetime) as they are normally
  battery powered. In this paper, for sensor nodes that are utilized to monitor
  oil pipelines, we study the linear sensor placement problem with the goal of
  maximizing their lifetime. For a simple equal-distance placement scheme, we
  first illustrate that the result based on the widely used ideal power model
  can be misleading (i.e., adding more sensor nodes can improve WSN's lifetime)
  when compared to that of a realistic power model derived from Tmote Sky
  sensors. Then, we study equal-power placement schemes and formulate the
  problem as a MILP (mixed integer linear programming) problem. In addition, two
  efficient placement heuristics are proposed. The evaluation results show that,
  even with the Tmote power model, the equal-power placement schemes can improve
  the WSN's lifetime by up to 29% with properly selected number of sensor nodes,
  the distance between them and the corresponding transmission power levels.
  Moreover, one heuristic scheme actually obtains almost the same results as
  that of MILP, which is optimal. The real deployment in one oil field is also
  discussed.
