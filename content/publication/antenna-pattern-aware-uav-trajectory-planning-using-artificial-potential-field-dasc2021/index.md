abstract: This work studies the trajectory design and collision avoidance of
  both single and multiple UAVs. During a mission, UAVs communicate with each
  other and multiple ground base stations (GBS). Additionally, UAVs are equipped
  with different antenna patterns which impact the trajectory design of the
  UAVs. To achieve efficient performance in UAVs trajectory planning, we propose
  and implement an Enhanced-artificial potential field algorithm (Enhanced-APF).
  The proposed algorithm shows the trajectory design of the UAV collision
  avoidance of multiple obstacles and the overall impact of the 3D antenna
  patterns on the UAV trajectory.
