abstract: WirelessHART is a networking technology that is widely used in
  industrial wireless sensor networks. Its reliability and real-time performance
  are essential to industrial production. Many works have studied these two
  aspects, primarily focusing on a single WirelessHART network. However,
  multiple WirelessHART networks usually coexist in a real industrial
  environment. Applying existing approaches to such coexisting networks would
  cause performance degradation due to communication interference among these
  networks. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that optimizes both
  reliability and temporality for multiple coexisting networks. The framework
  consists of two levels. The upper-level targets communication channel
  management, and the lower level addresses data flow scheduling. For the upper
  level, we propose a network isolation algorithm that improves the data
  transmission reliability through dynamically adjusting channel assignments to
  different WirelessHART networks. For the lower level, we propose data flow
  scheduling algorithms that guarantee the temporality of data flows within each
  isolated network. These algorithms minimize the number of channels reserved by
  each isolated network and further enhance transmission reliability by
  alleviating channel resource contention. We conduct trace-driven simulations
  of the channel management algorithm, and the results demonstrate that our
  algorithm exhibits stable performance and reduces packet loss by 36%. For the
  scheduling algorithms, the simulations demonstrate that in contrast with
  existing algorithms, the greater the number of coexisting networks, the fewer
  resources our algorithms use. When eight networks coexist, our algorithms
  outperform existing ones by consuming up to 63% fewer channel resources.
