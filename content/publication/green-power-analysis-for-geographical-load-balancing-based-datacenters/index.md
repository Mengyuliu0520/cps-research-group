abstract: "Variability and intermittency of green power is the main obstacle for
  its utilization. Different from other power consumption, due to the
  distributed nature, load balancing on geographical range can be used to
  dispatch computing tasks to the data centers with abundant renewable energy.
  The premise of this new strategy is: there is always abundant green power at
  some of the renewable power portfolio, yet this is not always the truth. The
  stable availability of renewable energy is built on the compensation of
  different power plants, but due to the constraint of constructed data centers
  and the on-site powering strategy, this compensation effect has not been fully
  explored. In this paper, we propose a solution for Renewable Energy Portfolio
  Optimization (REPO) problem, and take wind farm location selection as an
  example to stabilize the variable and intermittent wind power. The simulation
  is conducted based on the real-world climatic traces from 607 candidate wind
  farms. The optimal renewable energy portfolio can provide stable wind power
  supply at the price of 70 USD/MWh. When simulated with Google workload trace
  of May 2011, with installed capacity 4 times of average power demand, REPO can
  save 59.5% of energy while a combination (on Google data center locations)
  without consideration of mutual compensation could only save 30%."
