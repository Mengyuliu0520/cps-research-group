abstract: To reduce cost and emission, modern datacenter operators are beginning
  to incorporate green energy sources into datacenters' power supply. To improve
  service availability, they also back up datacenters using traditional (usually
  brown) energy sources. However, challenge arises due to distinct
  characteristics of energy sources used for different goals. How to select
  optimal energy sources and plan their capacity for datacenters to meet cost,
  emission and service availability requirement remains an open research
  problem. In this extended abstract, we briefly describe recent work in [4],
  which provides a holistic solution to address this problem. In [4], we present
  GreenPlanning, a framework to strike a judicious balance among multiple energy
  sources, the electrical grid and energy storage devices for a datacenter in
  terms of cost, emission, and service availability. GreenPlanning explores
  different features and operations of both green and traditional energy sources
  available to datacenters. The framework minimizes the lifetime total cost
  including both capital and operational cost for a datacenter. We conduct
  extensive experiments to evaluate GreenPlanning with real-life computational
  workload and meteorological data traces. Results demonstrate that
  GreenPlanning can reduce the lifetime total cost and emission by more than 50%
  compared to traditional configurations without integration of green energy,
  while still meeting service availability requirement.
