abstract: Megawatt-scale datacenters have emerged to meet the increasing demand
  for IT applications and services. The hunger for power brings large
  electricity bills to datacenter operators and causes significant impacts to
  the environment. To reduce costs and environmental impacts, modern
  datacenters, such as those of Google and Apple, are beginning to integrate
  renewable or green energy sources into their power supply. This article
  investigates the green-energy-aware power management problem for these
  datacenters and surveys and classifies works that explicitly consider
  renewable energy and/or carbon emission. Our aim is to give a full view of
  this problem. Hence, we first provide some basic knowledge on datacenters
  (including datacenter components, power infrastructure, power load estimation,
  and energy sources' operations), the electrical grid (including dynamic
  pricing, power outages, and emission factor), and the carbon market (including
  cap-and-trade and carbon tax). Then, we categorize existing research works
  according to their basic approaches used, including workload scheduling,
  virtual machine management, and energy capacity planning. Each category's
  discussion includes the description of the shared core idea, qualitative
  analysis, and quantitative analysis among works of this category.
