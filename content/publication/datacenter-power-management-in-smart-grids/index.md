abstract: Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm and it is gaining wide
  popularity due to its benefits including reduced cost, ease of management, and
  increased reliability. In a cloud computing environment, companies or
  individuals offload their computing (hardware/software/data) to the cloud,
  which is supported by the computing infrastructure called datacenters.
  Datacenters consume large amounts of electricity to operate and bring enormous
  electricity bills to the operators. Associated carbon emissions from operating
  datacenters also cause significant negative impact to the environment. In the
  mean time, a new kind of electrical grid, called the smart grid, is emerging.
  Smart grids enable two way communications between the power generators and the
  power consumers. Smart grid technology brings many salient features to help
  deliver power efficiently and reliably. There are many research efforts
  addressing either of the two tracks above. Different with them, we consider
  both and focus on cost-aware datacenter power management in presence of smart
  grids. We review recent developments on this area in this article. It involves
  understanding how a smart grid operates, where power goes in datacenters, and
  most importantly, how to reduce the power cost and/or negative environmental
  impact when operating datacenters.
