abstract: "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication has raised increasing
  attention from both academia and industry due to its exceptional advantages.
  Compared with existing wireless communication techniques, such as WiFi and 4G,
  mmWave communications adopt much higher carrier frequencies and thus come with
  advantages including huge bandwidth, narrow beam, high transmission quality,
  and strong detection ability. These advantages can well address difficult
  situations caused by recent popular applications using wireless technologies.
  For example, mmWave communications can significantly alleviate the
  skyrocketing traffic demand of wireless communication from video streaming.
  Meanwhile, mmWave communications have several natural disadvantages, e.g.,
  severe signal attenuation, easily blocked by obstacles, and small coverage,
  due to its short wavelengths. Hence, the major challenge is how to overcome
  its shortcomings while fully utilizing its advantages. In this paper, we
  present a taxonomy based on the layered model and give an extensive review of
  mmWave communications. Specially, we divide existing efforts into four
  categories that investigate: the physical layer, medium access control (MAC)
  layer, network layer, and cross-layer optimization, respectively. First, we
  present an overview of some technical details in the physical layer. Second,
  we summarize available literature in the MAC layer that pertains to protocols
  and scheduling schemes. Third, we make an in-depth survey of related research
  work in the network layer, providing brainstorming and methodology for
  enhancing the capacity and coverage of mmWave networks. Fourth, we analyze
  available research work related to cross-layer allocation/optimization for
  mmWave communications. Fifth, we make a review of mmWave applications to
  illustrate how mmWave technology can be employed to satisfy other services. At
  the end of each section described above, we point out the inadequacy of
  existing work and identify the future work. Sixth, we present some available
  resources for mmWave communications, including related books about mmWave,
  commonly used mmWave frequencies, existing protocols based on mmWave, and
  experimental platforms. Finally, we have a simple summary and point out
  several promising future research directions."
