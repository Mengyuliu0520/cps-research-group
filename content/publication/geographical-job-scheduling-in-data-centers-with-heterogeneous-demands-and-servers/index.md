abstract: The fast proliferation of cloud computing promotes the rapid
  development of large-scale commercial data centers. Tens or even hundreds of
  geographically distributed data centers have been deployed for better
  reliability and quality of services. This brings huge energy consumption for
  data centers. Previous research has proved that the geographical load
  balancing technique can achieve significant energy cost savings for
  geographically distributed data centers. However, existing methods for
  geographical load balancing often assume data centers with homogeneous
  servers, and workloads with single-dimension or uniform resource demands. This
  is an over-simplification in reality, especially when modern data centers are
  typically constructed from a variety of server classes. In this paper, we
  systematically study the problem of job scheduling for geographically
  distributed data centers to embrace the heterogeneity of underlying platforms
  and workloads. We develop a novel distributed algorithm to solve the problem
  efficiently based on the alternating direction method of multipliers.
  Extensive evaluations based on real-life data center topology, traffic traces,
  and electricity price data show high efficiency and efficacy of our method.
