abstract: "Electric vehicles (EVs) represent one of the most promising
  technologies to green the transportation systems. An important issue is that
  high penetration of EVs brings heavy electricity demand to the power grid. One
  effective way to alleviate the impact is to integrate local power generation
  such as renewable energy sources (RESs) into charging infrastructure. Because
  of the intermittent and indispatchable nature of RESs, it becomes very
  challenging to coordinate EVs charging with other grid load and renewable
  generation. In this paper, EVs charging problem in the presence of smart grid
  technologies is investigated, and the interaction with renewable energy is
  reviewed. An overview about EVs and RESs is first presented, which mainly
  introduces major types of EVs and renewable energy estimation methods. Then,
  according to the objectives, the existing research works are divided into
  three categories: cost-aware, efficiency-aware, and emissions-aware
  interactions between EVs and RESs. Each category×³s discussion includes the
  description of core ideas, summarization of solutions, and comparison between
  different works. Finally, some key open issues about EVs interacting with RESs
  are given and some possible solutions are also discussed."
