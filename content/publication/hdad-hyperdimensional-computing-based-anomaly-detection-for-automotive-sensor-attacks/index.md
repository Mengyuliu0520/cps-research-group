abstract: As the connectivity of autonomous vehicles keeps growing, it is an
  accepted fact that they are even more vulnerable to malicious cyber-attacks.
  Recently, sensor spoofing has become an emerging attack that can compromise
  vehicle safety as vehicles are equipped with more sensors. Thus, it is
  critical to validate the sensor readings before utilizing them for future
  actions. In this paper, we develop HDAD, a hyperdimensional computing-based
  anomaly detection method. Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging
  brain-inspired computing paradigm that mimics the brain cognition and
  leverages hyperdimensional vectors with fully distributed holographic
  representation and (pseudo)randomness. The key idea of HDAD is to use HDC to
  build encoder and decoder to reconstruct the sensor readings. The anomalous
  data typically have comparatively higher reconstruction errors than normal
  sensor readings. We explore three different metrics to measure the
  reconstruction error including mean squared error, mean absolute error, and
  cosine similarity. Using a real-world vehicle sensor reading dataset, we
  demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of HDAD, opening the door for a new
  set of anomaly detection algorithm design.
