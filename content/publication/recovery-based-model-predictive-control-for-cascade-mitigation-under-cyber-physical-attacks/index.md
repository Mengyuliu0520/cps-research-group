abstract: The ever-growing threats of cascading failures due to cyber-attacks
  pose a significant challenge to power grid security. A wrong system state
  estimate caused by a false data injection attack could lead to a wrong control
  actions and take the system into a more insecure operating condition. As a
  consequence, an attack-resilient failure mitigation strategy needs to be
  developed to correctly determine control actions to prevent the propagation of
  cascades. In this paper, a recovery-based model predictive control methodology
  is developed to eliminate power system component violations following
  coordinated cyber-physical attacks where physical attacks are masked by
  targeted false data injection attacks. Specifically, to address the problem of
  wrong system state estimation with compromised data, a developed methodology
  recovers the incorrect states from historical data rather than utilizing the
  tampered data, and thus allowing control centers to identify proper control
  actions. Additionally, instead of using a one-step method to optimize control
  actions, the recovery-based model predictive control methodology scheme
  incorporates the effect of controls over a finite time horizon and the attack
  detection delay to make appropriate control decisions. Case studies, performed
  on IEEE 30-bus and Illinois 200-bus systems, show that the developed
  recovery-based model predictive control methodology scheme is robust to
  coordinated attacks and efficient in mitigating cascades.
