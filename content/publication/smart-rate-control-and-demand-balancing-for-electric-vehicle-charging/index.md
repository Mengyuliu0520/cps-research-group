abstract: "The anticipated high electric vehicle (EV) penetration motivates many
  research efforts to alleviate the potential associated grid impact. However,
  few works discuss the crucial issue: quality of service (QoS) degradation
  caused by competing for charging resources. This issue arises due to the
  limitation on power supply and charging space that charging stations can
  usually provide. Our work studies this issue and proposes an operational
  scheme that optimizes QoS for EV users while satisfying the stability of the
  power grid. The scheme consists of two levels. The lower level deals with
  charging rate control, for which we propose an efficient algorithm with
  provable QoS-optimal allocation of power supply to EVs. The upper level
  handles charging demand balancing, for which we design two approximation
  algorithms that schedule EVs to multiple charging stations. One algorithm is a
  3-approximation with polynomial complexity; while the other is a
  (2+Îµ)-approximation using a fully polynomial time approximation scheme.
  Through extensive simulations based on realistic data traces and simulations
  tools, we demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our operational scheme
  and further provide interesting findings from in-depth analysis of the
  experimental results."
