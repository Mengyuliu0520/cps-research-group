abstract: Power management is becoming an increasingly important issue for
  Internet services supported by multiple geo-distributed data centers. These
  data center's energy consumptions and costs are becoming unacceptably high,
  and placing a heavy burden on both energy resources and the environment.
  Emerging smart grid provides a feasible way for dynamic and efficient power
  management of data centers. Various power management methodologies based on
  geographic load balancing (GLB) have recently been proposed to effectively
  utilize several features of smart grid. In this paper, we summarize the
  motivations, current state of the art, approaches and techniques proposed in
  the recent research works in this discipline. In all of these works, many
  perspectives of power management have been addressed using various computer
  science principles. We specifically elaborate on how researchers are
  exploiting mathematical tools to address these perspectives. Finally, we point
  out subject matters that need more attentions from the research community and
  provide our vision on possible future works along this direction.
