abstract: "The growing awareness about global climate change has boosted the
  need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power systems and
  spurred efforts to accelerate the integration of renewable energy sources
  (e.g. wind and solar power) into the electrical grid. A fundamental difficulty
  here is that renewable energy sources are usually of high variability. The
  electrical grid must absorb this variability through employing many additional
  operations (e.g., operating reserves, energy storage), which will largely
  raise the cost of electricity from renewable energy sources. To make it
  affordable, numerous advancements in technologies and methods for the smart
  grid are required. In this paper, we will confine ourselves to one of them:
  how to plan the construction of wind farms with high capacity and low
  variability locally and distributedly. We first study the characteristics of
  both wind resources and wind turbines and present a more accurate wind power
  evaluation method based on Gaussian Regression. Then, we analyze a trade-off
  between wind power's quantity and quality and propose an approach to optimally
  combine different types of wind turbines to balance the trade-off for a
  specific site. Finally, we explore geographical diversity among different
  sites and develop an extended approach that jointly optimizes the combination
  of sites and turbine types. Extensive experiments using the realistic
  historical wind resource data are conducted for either of the local and
  distributed case. Encouraging results are shown for the proposed approaches
  and some interesting insights are also provided."
