abstract: "Charging stations have become indispensable infrastructure to support
  the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs). The operational scheme of
  charging stations is crucial to satisfy the stability of the power grid and
  the quality of service (QoS) to EV users. Most existing schemes target either
  of the two major operations: charging rate control and demand balancing. This
  partial focus overlooks the coupling relation between the two operations and
  thus causes the degradation on the grid stability or customer QoS. A
  thoughtful scheme should manage both operations together. A big challenge to
  design such a scheme is the aggregated uncertainty caused by their coupling
  relation. This uncertainty accumulates from three aspects: the renewable
  generators co-located with charging stations, the power load of other (or
  non-EV) consumers, and the charging demand arriving in the future. To handle
  this aggregated uncertainty, we propose a stochastic optimization based
  operational scheme. The scheme jointly manages charging rate control and
  demand balancing to satisfy both the grid stability and user QoS. Further, our
  scheme consists of two algorithms that we design for managing the two
  operations respectively. An appealing feature of our algorithms is that they
  have robust performance guarantees in terms of the prediction errors on these
  three aspects. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
  operational scheme and also validate our theoretical results."
