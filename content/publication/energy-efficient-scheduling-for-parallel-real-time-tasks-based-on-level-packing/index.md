abstract: While much work has addressed energy-efficient scheduling for
  sequential tasks where each task can run on only one processor at a time,
  little work has been done for parallel tasks where an individual task can be
  executed by multiple processors simultaneously. In this paper, we develop
  energy minimizing algorithms for parallel task systems with timing guarantees.
  For parallel tasks executed by a fixed number of processors, we first propose
  several heuristic algorithms based on level-packing for task scheduling, and
  then present a polynomial-time complexity energy minimizing algorithm which is
  optimal for any given level-packed task schedule. For parallel tasks that can
  run on a variable number of processors, we propose another polynomial-time
  complexity algorithm to determine the number of processors executing each
  task, task schedule and frequency assignment. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first work that addresses energy-efficient scheduling for parallel
  real-time tasks. Our simulation result shows that the proposed approach can
  significantly reduce the system energy consumption.
