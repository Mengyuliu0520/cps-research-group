abstract: "The valley-to-peak difference in power consumption is a crucial
  problem in load regulation and control for a power grid. By allowing electric
  vehicles (EVs) to charge during off-peak hours and feed power back into the
  grid during peak hours, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology can help to shave the
  power peak. Long-distance communication is essential for data exchange between
  dispersed EVs and charging stations for the realization of V2G systems.
  However, because of the high mobility of EVs, the high-volume data
  transmission required and the limitations of the third-party infrastructure,
  it is challenging to achieve efficient and effective communication. To address
  these challenges, we propose a new V2G network architecture based on
  software-defined networking (SDN) technology. (1) We use an IEEE 802.11
  WiFi-based long-distance (WiLD) network with the TDMA scheme as the backhaul
  network, and (2) we partially replace the roadside units (RSUs) with some of
  the WiLD nodes to provide access for and to rapidly broadcast data to, EVs. In
  addition, we propose: (3) a two-stage flow table mechanism and a double
  roaming mechanism to address the mobility demands of V2G network terminals;
  and (4) a rapid data transmission scheme for communication from charging
  stations to EVs. A testbed was built to validate the proposed network
  architecture. Experimental results show that the communication time delay is
  in the order of milliseconds and that the reliability is higher than 99.9%. "
