abstract: A smart factory generates vast amounts of data that require
  transmission via large-scale wireless networks. Thus, the reliability and
  real-time performance of large-scale wireless networks are essential for
  industrial production. A distributed data transmission scheme is suitable for
  large-scale networks but is incapable of optimizing performance. By contrast,
  a centralized scheme relies on knowledge of global information and is hindered
  by scalability issues. To overcome these limitations, a hybrid scheme is
  needed. We propose a hierarchical data transmission framework that integrates
  the advantages of these schemes and makes a tradeoff between real-time
  performance, reliability, and scalability. The top-level perform
  coarse-grained management to improve scalability and reliability by
  coordinating communication resources among subnetworks. The bottom level
  performs fine-grained management in each subnetwork, for which we propose an
  intrasubnetwork centralized scheduling algorithm to schedule periodic and
  aperiodic flows. We conduct both extensive simulations and realistic testbed
  experiments. The results indicate that our method has better schedulability
  and reduces packet loss by up to 22% relative to existing methods.
