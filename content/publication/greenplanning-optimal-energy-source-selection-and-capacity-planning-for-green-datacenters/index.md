abstract: Cloud service providers such as Microsoft and Google are beginning to
  power up their datacenters using multiple energy sources. To reduce cost and
  emission, they incorporate green energy sources into the power supply, while
  to improve service availability, they back up datacenters using traditional
  (usually brown) energy sources. However, challenge arises due to distinct
  characteristics of energy sources used for different goals. How to select
  optimal energy sources and plan their capacity for constructing datacenters to
  meet cost, emission and service availability requirement remains to be fully
  explored. This work provides a holistic solution to address this problem. We
  present GreenPlanning, a framework to strike a judicious balance among
  multiple energy sources, grid power and energy storage devices for a
  datacenter in terms of the above three goals. GreenPlanning investigates
  different features and operations of a wide spectrum of green and brown energy
  sources available to datacenters. The framework minimizes the lifetime total
  cost including both capital and operational cost for a datacenter. We conduct
  extensive simulations to evaluate GreenPlanning with real-life computational
  workload and meteorological data traces. Results demonstrate that
  GreenPlanning can reduce the lifetime total cost and emission by more than 50%
  compared to traditional configurations, while still satisfying service
  availability requirement.
